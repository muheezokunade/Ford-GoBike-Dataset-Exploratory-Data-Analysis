# Project Title: Ford GoBike Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis

## Project Description:

This project aims to explore the Ford GoBike dataset, which includes information on bike rentals from the Ford GoBike bike sharing service in the San Francisco Bay Area. The analysis will examine various aspects of bike rentals, including patterns of usage, characteristics of users, and factors that may influence demand. The goal of this analysis is to understand the use of bike sharing services in the San Francisco Bay Area and to identify potential areas for improvement.

## Data Source:

The data for this analysis was obtained from the [Ford GoBike dataset] (https://www.ford.com/). The dataset includes information on [relevant variables] for [time period] of bike rentals in the San Francisco Bay Area.

## Analysis Steps:

Load and clean the data

Explore the distribution of bike rentals by location and time

Investigate the characteristics of bike rentals, including duration, start and end locations, and user type

Identify patterns and trends in bike rentals

Identify potential areas for improvement in the bike sharing service

## Summary of Findings

In summary, the findings shows the richness of the data when i combined my previous knowledge of the last project on data wrangling with this on visualization. combining data warngling (even though some are not commented or put on a markdown) and exploration using visualization made the work more rich. I used the question, visualization and observation format for each exploration. Conversion of some of the variables like latitiude and longitude to obtain distance and duration_sec to obtain minutes and importantly to days of the week(mon,tue,wed... sunday) assisted in my exploration. Having an upper and lower Limit on member birth year due to much data gave a better visualizationa and understanding of the data. Tools like xlimit for the x-axis on some variabes made our data visualization clearer as we truncated outliers. The list below list our findings: Thursdays have more rides while weekends have less rides. subscribers take on far more rides than customers more males take on rides than females with a large difference Most users to large extent did not share their bikes as only just a few did. no customer shared his/her ride. trip distance is usually between 5 to 7 minutes San Francisco Caltrain Station 2 (Townsend St at 4th St) station had more rides than any station and customers had more rides than subscribers.


## Key Insights for Presentation

Key insights for my presentation center around Conversion of some of the variables like latitiude and longitude to obtain distance and duration_sec to obtain minutes and importantly to days of the week(mon,tue,wed... sunday), using knowledge of data wrangling and both exploratory and explanatory visualization
